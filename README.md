# 
# This is VBA script called TickerLooping() that tracks stock market 
# changes in years 2018 - 2020 # based on Multiple_year_stock_data.xls 
# as the raw data.
#
# Ticker is referred as the 3 letter abbreviation of the stock name. 
#
# TickerLooping() scans the yearly change from the beginning of the 
# year of the opening price to the end of the year of the closing
# price and produces the yearly change and the percent change on 
# the worksheet of that year for each ticker.
#
# There is conditional formatting added to indicate the colour green 
# for percent changes at or above 0 and conditional formatting of the 
# colour red to indicate percent change below 0.
#
# The script also tracks the total volume of the ticker stock trading.
#
# Also summarized are three indicators of yearly ticker stock activity
# - ticker with greatest % increase
# - ticker with greatest % decrease
# - ticker with greatest volume
#
# Included are screen shots of the yearly worksheets from 2018 to 2020.
